<h2 class="style1">The Polar Cloud</h2>
<p>With the <a href="https://polar3d.com">Polar Cloud</a> you can securely control your printer remotely! (But please do be safety conscious!)</p>
<p> The Polar Cloud provides you access to your printer from anywhere in the world, using any WebGL-capable web browser.  The Polar Cloud is even tablet and phone friendly.  Chromebooks and even the newest, inexpensive Amazon Fire tablets are supported.</p>
<p>With the Polar Cloud you can  share your printers with others. You can grant &quot;queue &amp; view&quot; access to individuals and groups. Or you can even grant management rights to individuals and groups. In the Polar Cloud you can store and save STL files as well as find full information on past prints including the slicing configuration, allowing you to requeue old print jobs.</p>
<p>With Google Drive and BlocksCAD, you can send STL files directly to the Polar Cloud. With <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> you can receive notifications when prints are queued, started, completed, finished, or deleted from the queue.</p>
<h2 class="style1">Configuring your Polar Cloud account</h2>
<p>To access the <a href="https://polar3d.com" target="_blank">Polar Cloud</a> you will need an account with Google, Facebook, or Microsoft Live: the Polar Cloud uses the &quot;login&quot; services of those  providers to enhance security.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Note: with Google you will be asked to approve Google Drive access as well as access to Google Classroom. The Google Drive access is to allow you to pull STLs from your Google Drive. The Classroom access is for our large community of school teachers who use the Polar Cloud to facilitate 3D printing activities within their physical classrooms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you do not have an account with Google, Facebook, or Microsoft, you will need to create one. You can associate most any e-mail address of yours with any of those services; you do not, for example, need to create a gmail account with Google. Please refer to <a href="https://polar3d.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/9000108915-linking-your-current-email-address-to-a-google-microsoft-or-facebook-account" target="_blank">this article for help creating an account with one of those three providers</a>.</p>
<p>When you have an account with Google, Facebook, or Microsoft Live, you're ready to log in to the Polar Cloud. Just<br />
navigate to</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://polar3d.com" target="_blank">https://polar3d.com</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You'll be presented with a login screen with three login buttons, one for each of the three providers. Click the appropriate one and login.</p>
<p><img src="images/login.png" width="825" height="547" /></p>
<p>Your Polar Cloud account will automatically be created for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Finding your account's PIN</h2>
<p>Once logged in you should see the home page,</p>
<p><img src="images/account-settings.png" alt="account-settings" width="638" height="367" /></p>
<p>On the home page, click your profile image in the upper right corner and select the &quot;Settings&quot; menu item. This will take you to your account settings page where you can see (and change) your account's PIN number. It is located near the bottom of the page. You will need that PIN number when registering your Octoprint server with the Polar Cloud.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>To register a printer with the Polar Cloud you will need a Polar Cloud account. To Octoprint, you will supply the e-mail address associated with your Polar Cloud account as well as your PIN number. Octoprint will connect to the cloud using SSL/TLS and provide the account information as well as a public RSA crypto key it has generated.  Once validated by the cloud, a unique serial number will be sent back to Octoprint. Then each time Octoprint connects to the cloud, it will validate itself through use of its private RSA crypto key.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Loading a STL file to your account</h2>
<p>Once your printer is registered, you'll want to know about the &quot;hamburger&quot; menu in the upper left corner of all Polar Cloud web pages. Locate it and click it,</p>
<p><img src="images/hamburger-menu-1.png" alt="Locate the hamburger menu" width="638" height="367" /></p>
<p>Once clicked, a menu will appear,</p>
<p><img src="images/hamburger-menu-2.png" alt="Opened hamburger menu" width="638" height="425" /></p>
<p>From this menu you can navigate to see the printers you own, manage, or have access to. Or you can go to the pages of public, shared, and private objects as we'll next do. Groups are visited via the &quot;groups&quot; item. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Load an object to your printer's virtual build plate</h2>
<p>At the objects page, click the UPLOAD button near the upper right,</p>
<p><img src="images/upload.png" alt="Upload button" width="638" height="400" /></p>
<p>With the resulting upload dialog you can upload one or more STL files. They will be saved to a private object of your own and you will be given the choice of viewing the object or going to the printer's virtual build plate. Choose going to the build plate.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Note that if you logged in using Google, you can choose to load files from Google Drive. Further, when at Google Drive, you can send STL files directly to your printer's virtual build plate by right-clicking on a STL file, selecting Open With, and then choosing  Polar Cloud.</p>
  </blockquote>
<h2>Printer Configuration</h2>
<p>If, when registering your printer, you selected either the generic Cartesian or Delta printer type, you will want to do a one-time configuration of your printer. This is done by duplicating one of the default slicing profiles, giving it a friendly name, setting some printer characteristics, and then saving the configuration. Each time you then go to the virtual build plate to make a new print job or edit an existing one, your saved configuration will be amongst the configuration choices you have. Your slicer settings are also saved in the configuration. As such, you will likely create many different saved configurations.</p>
<p>At the virtual build plate, select the Print Settings tab near the upper right,</p>
<p><img src="images/build-plate.png" alt="Print Settings tab" width="638" height="550" /></p>
<p>Then click the slicer config button shown circled in red below,</p>
<p><img src="images/slicer-config.png" alt="Slicer config button" width="334" height="413" /></p>
<p>Upon clicking that button, a popup dialog will appear showing the available slicer configurations,</p>
<p><img src="images/slicer-configs.png" alt="Slicer config listing" width="498" height="327" /></p>
<p>Click the most suitable config. Then back in the print settings, duplicate this config by clicking the duplicate icon near the upper right.</p>
<p><img src="images/duplicate-slicing-config.png" alt="Duplicate the config" width="638" height="597" /></p>
<p>Once the config is duplicated, select the &quot;Name&quot; field under the &quot;BASIC&quot; 
settings tab and change the configuration's   name to something more friendly,</p>
<p><img src="images/slicing-config-name-1.png" alt="Slicing config name" width="638" height="500" /></p>
<p><img src="images/slicing-config-name-2.png" alt="Slicing config name" width="638" height="500" /></p>
<p>Once you have a reasonable name, click the &quot;PRINTER&quot; tab directly above the &quot;ADVANCED&quot; tab. Once it is clicked a dialog with printer settings will appear,</p>
<p><img src="images/machine-defs.png" alt="Printer settings" width="638" height="500" /></p>
<p>With this dialog you can control the type of build plate (rectangular or circular), the dimensions of the build volume, and whether or not the origin (0,0) in the XY-plane is at a corner of the build plate or at the center.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Polar Cloud centers models at (0,0). Thus, when the resulting STL is sent to your printer, it is important to know where the origin of your printer's build plate is. If it is at a corner, the Cura &quot;posx&quot; and &quot;posy&quot; settings will be used and set, respectively, to half the build volume's X and Y lengths.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you have made any adjustments to the settings, you can click &quot;PREVIEW BUILD PLATE&quot; button to see the adjusted build plate. Then click the &quot;PRINTER&quot; tab again to dismiss the dialog.<br />
</p>
<p>Make changes to other slicer settings. <u>And adjust your starting and ending gcode under the &quot;GCODE&quot; tab</u>. When you are done, save your configuration by clicking the save icon,</p>
<p><img src="images/save-slicing-config.png" alt="Save the config" width="638" height="500" /></p>
<p>When you've adjusted the model on the build plate and are satisfied, click the &quot;PRINT&quot; button in the upper right. This will generate a STL file, a rendering of your build plate, and a Cura slicing configuration. All will be stored in the cloud. The progress is displayed with a spinner in the bottom right of your screen. Once everything has been stored, you will be taken to the printer's &quot;dashboard&quot;. From the dashboard you can start, pause, and stop prints. You can also see the queued jobs for the printer,</p>
<p><img src="images/queued-jobs.png" alt="Queued jobs" width="530" height="188" /></p>
<p>By clicking on the vertical dots in the upper right of a job &quot;tile&quot;, you can perform actions on the job such as editing it to add more objects to it,</p>
<p><img src="images/queued-job-options.png" alt="Queued job actions" width="640" height="191" /></p>
<p>When you edit a job, you can load additional models to it from various sources. You can even load models from another print job, thereby combing two jobs into one.</p>
