## Easily Monitor Your Prints from Anywhere

The Polar Cloud at [polar3d.com](https://polar3d.com) is accessible from
anywhere, inside or outside of the printer's local network.

## Print Queue

You can prepare multiple prints, queue them up and send them one by one to your
printer

## Manage Multiple Printers

You can connect more than one printer to your Polar Cloud account and manage
them all from one place.

## Object Library

You can upload your objects to Polar Cloud, share them with other cloud
members, and send them to your printer.

## IFTTT

Polar Cloud is an IFTTT service, so you can easily set things up to happen when
various events happen with your printer connected to Polar Cloud. See [Polar3D's
IFTTT Applets](https://ifttt.com/polar3d)

## README - Getting Started

There's a few steps to get up and running (beyond installing the plugin).
